# Counting words with Ternary Search Trees

This repository contains my own implementation of doubly-linked lists, Ternary Search Trees and an example program `count.c` which uses a TST and a list to efficiently count the number of occurances of each word in given text.

Please look at individual readme files to learn more about each module.

The implemenations of doubly linked lists and TSTs have been both thoroughly tested. For TSTs this involves not only inserting, searching and deleting, but also going through the internal strucutre of the tree and making sure that all nodes and pointers are in the state that is expected.
